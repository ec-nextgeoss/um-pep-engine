= Building Block Design

[NOTE]
.Content Description
================================
This section contains:

* A concise breakdown of the Building Block in several independent services (when applicable). For each component, the following subsections are added:
** Overview and purpose: indicating the functionality covered by the component
** SW Reuse and Dependencies: indicating reuse of third party open source solutions (if any) and any pre-required Dependencies
** Interfaces: both internal to the building block and those exposed externally
** Data: Data usage of the building block, data flow and any GDPR concerns should be addressed here
** Applicable Resources: links and references to (Reference Docs), and repositories.

When a breakdown is necessary, a general overview of the building block can be given. On the contrary, no breakdown indicates a single component development with the same expected sections.

== Reverse Proxy Service
=== Overview and Purpose
The Flask-based reverse proxy serves as the interface for input queries. This reverse proxy is in charge of recieving the queries and returning the appropiate HTTP response. 

=== Software Reuse and Dependencies

All requirements for the executing of the reverse proxy are found under src/requirements.txt, and expect Python 3.6.9 or greater to work.

The most important are:

* **EOEPCA-SCIM**: Used to auto-register itself as a client to the Auth. Server upon startup
* **EOEPCA-UMA**: Used as the backbone of the PEP, allows for generation of tickets, verification of RPTs, and any other UMA-related action.
* **WellKnownHandler**: Used to dynamically check the configuration of the Authorization Server on each execution. For example, it can get the needed endpoints for any API the PEP needs, such as the token request for OIDC.
* **Flask**: External to EOEPCA's project, this library allows the PEP to create the actual reverse proxy, sending and recieving custom requests.

=== Interfaces

This component doesn't have any internal interfaces. For a reference of external interfaces see <<External Interfaces>> on Section 2 <<Overview>>

=== Data

==== Configuration

The PEP gets all its configuration from the file located under `config/config.json`.

The parameters that are accepted, and their meaning, are as follows:

- **realm**: 'realm' parameter answered for each UMA ticket. Default is "eoepca"
- **auth_server_url**: complete url (with "https") of the Authorization server.
- **proxy_endpoint**: "/path"-formatted string to indicate where the reverse proxy should listen. The proxy will catch any request that starts with that path. Default is "/pep"
- **service_host**: Host for the proxy to listen on. For example, "0.0.0.0" will listen on all interfaces
- **service_port**: Port for the proxy to listen on. By default, **5566**. Keep in mind you will have to edit the docker file and/or kubernetes yaml file in order for all the prot forwarding to work.
- **s_margin_rpt_valid**: An integer representing how many seconds of "margin" do we want when checking RPT. For example, using **5** will make sure the provided RPT is valid now AND AT LEAST in the next 5 seconds.
- **check_ssl_certs**: Toggle on/off (bool) to check certificates in all requests. This should be forced to True in a production environment
- **use_threads**: Toggle on/off (bool) the usage of threads for the proxy. Recommended to be left as True.
- **debug_mode**: Toggle on/off (bool) a debug mode of Flask. In a production environment, this should be false.
- **resource_server_endpoint**: Complete url (with "https" and any port) of the Resource Server to protect with this PEP.
- **client_id**: string indicating a client_id for an already registered and configured client. **This parameter is optional**. When not supplied, the PEP will generate a new client for itself and store it in this key inside the JSON.
- **client_secret**: string indicating the client secret for the client_id. **This parameter is optional**. When not supplied, the PEP will generate a new client for itself and store it in this key inside the JSON.

==== Data flow

The only information the PEP handles are tickets given by the Auth Server, and RPTs which are sent only to the Auth Server.

All data is ephimeral at the time of writting, except the data stored at the config file. The resources are loaded into a mongo database, this allows to store large amounts of resources and more complex queries.

What follows is an example of the nominal flow for the PEP, and "ADES" is the Resource Server the PEP is protecting:

=== Extensibility

The design of the PEP allows for further improvements if need be. For example:

- The resource management in memory could be expanded to a full on DB, by changing how `custom_uma.py` works internally.
- The UMA library used allows for quick implementations for resource managing, such as creation, deleting and editing.
- The proxy can be expanded to parse further parameters on top of the HTTP protocol, allowing for any kind of plugin or complex mechanism desired.

== RESOURCE RESPOSITORY
=== Overview and Purpose
It is the database based on MongoDB where the resources are stored and queried for the PEP pourposes

Included with the PEP there is a script at the source path that performs queries against a Mongo Database. The main purpose of this script is to reduce the usage of RAM when registering a resource locally and when querying for its content.
It is developed to generate a database called 'resource_db' in case it does not exist. The collection used for the storage of the documents is called 'resources'.
The script defines the following methods:

* **insert_in_mongo**: Will generate a document with the resource data recived as input if it alredy exists it will update it. The main parameters of the resource would be an auto-generated id provided by mongo which identify each document in the database, the resource_id provided by the login-service, and the reverse_match_url which will define the endpoint of the resource. This would be mandatory parameters in order to perform other kind of queries.
* **get_id_from_uri**: This feature will return the id for the best candidate of the match by a URI given.
* **delete_resource**: This function will recive a resource id and will find and delete the matched document

This script is manipulated by the API which would intercept the request in order to perform PUT,POST and DELETE methods.
The GET method would be called by the reverse proxy since it will be in charge of filtering the resource with the given URI

=== Software Reuse and Dependencies

The script needs the library 'pymongo', to query the database. It will expect a MongoDB service running on the default's Mongo port 27017
In order to simulate database responses for unit tests, is needed to use the python mock library.

This class would be called from APIs within the PEP repository. At the moment the usage is mainly for the resource interaction purposes, but this can easily be reused by other agents.

=== Data flow

The database will only be accesible by the API or the Proxy.
The main methods for the interaction with the database are displayed in this dataflow as a summary of its scope:
